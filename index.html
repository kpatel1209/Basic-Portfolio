            <p>Hi, I'm Kevin, a student at the Georgia Tech Web Development Bootcamp in Atlanta, GA.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Kennesaw State University with a Finance degree and have worked as a Business Operations Analyst for multiple consulting firms within the tech industry.  After spending several years in this field, I decided I had finally hit the end of the road and want to now pursue a challenging and fulfilling career within the Web Development world.</p>
            <p>I grew up in Atlanta and am a huge fan of our professional sports teams, especially the Atlanta Falcons.....who always find a way to break my heart each season.  But that's okay, there is always next season.</p>
            <p>My wife and I enjoy spending our free time outdoors hiking, traveling around the world, and eating/drinking our way through Atlanta. I also love listening to music, watching sports, and cooking partially edible meals .</p>
            <p>To learn more about me, please drop me a message on my Contact page. Thanks for visiting my first website!</p>
